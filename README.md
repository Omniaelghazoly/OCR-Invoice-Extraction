# OCR Invoice Data Extraction App (Streamlit + Gemini 2.0 Flash + LangChain)

This project extracts structured data (buyer name, invoice number, date, items, taxes, etc.) from **invoice images** using **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**, integrated through **LangChain**.  
It includes a simple **Streamlit** web app for uploading invoices and exporting results.
